WHY ARE YOU READING THIS >:CCCC

anyways i was joking lol XDD
so amm hello 
iam dragon g4mr (NICKNAME OFCOURCE WHAT DO YOU THINK LOL)

i like programming but at the moment iam interested in low level programming stuff sense they are light speed fast ðŸ‘€
even tho its hard i still like it -.-

iam currently at high school BUT i already used internet to learn ALOT of programming and programming and some more programming on top
currently IN MY PROGRAMMING INTERNET WORLD iam learning 
- java script (advanced)
- more C/C++ , assembly low level stuff :o
- and planning to learn more about networking and graphics soon... (not basic knowlge but DEEP ONE SUCH AS CREATING WHOLE APP JUST CONSTANTLY WRITING 0's & 1's FOR DAYS THEN THROWING THE WHOLE THING IN TRASH CUZ ITS BORING)

ok what about what did i already learn ? 
so i already learnt :
- C
- C++
- C#
- java
- assembly (i dont remember the whole instruction set tho, bro the internet exist and its filled with copies for it)
- python (never really gone that deep in it bc ITS TOO SLOW AND I WANT LIGHT SPEED APPS xd)
- HTML (PLEASE NO NEED TO SAY WOOOOOOOOOOW I KNOW THIS LANGUAGE AND I KNOW IS TOO HARD FOR SOMEONE TO LEARN IT)
- java script (currently learning it...)

ok what about the stuff i have done with these languages ?
i maybe made over 100 project (completely useless one's but fun to make) but the big ones i made were :
- big library in C# that makes doing alot of stuff easier (was my first big usefull project)
then i have project that i never really completed and just don't feel its really that useful to continue them OR its hard for 1 single devoloper to do them OR i was doing them the wrong way
- alot of games in UE4 and little in Unity 
- AN OPERATING SYSTEM using assembly (just wanted to learn it more deeply and how hardware stuff work)
- alot of projects in all languages and top one's are :
1- C# (bc it was first language i learn)
2- C/C++ & assembly (new languages i just learnt few months ago but almost all my projects are made with them combined)
3- java (bc it have some stuff faster than C#)
4- HTML (bc i learnt it before java script)
5- java script (yes java script is angry now HTML is used more than itself)
6- python (*python cries at corner*)
7- no no i don't really remember any other language i used
8- aaa stop .... i said no more
9- I SAID NO MORE OK ... GOOD

what am i currently working on ? 
in java iam making base core for a rendering engine that renders alot of stuff like (components that have events and graphics) & (transparency and being able to merge diffrent layers of colors just for being like 50% transperent)
in C/C++ iam working on 2 projects :
- programming language compiler and helpful programming toolkit and an IDE for that language
- virtual machine (just like vmware but specially made for this that programming language iam planning to make)

and also i almost done every thing i want to do with languages like C# and python -.- i may use them later when i need but currently i dont want to

am i searching for collaboration with someone or someteam ? 
i mean iam not really thinking of it sense i dont think i would be that useful yet ??(not confident about myself)


my questions to google that i couldn't really find an awnser to : 
1- how do i get access to the program frame buffer to make graphics work in my app light speed times faster than 7.2 FPS that C# gives me using picture box's and bitmaps 
- also i dont really just want to have access but i want to understand the whole topic and syscalls that i can use in windows / linux to make this happend
- and i dont want that to be depending on something like OpenGL or DirectX i just want to make my own (at least for my pc so i can understand its concepts)
- also i want to know about GPUs and how they work and how does my computer hardware & software comunicate with it to tell it for example (do that thing or render that framebuffer or whatever the GPU supports doing)

2- how does networking work (in detial) and how to make basic networking app in C++ then make it in assembly


-- priority for the graphics one first



last thing is how to contact me ?
i dont know i almost deleted all social and never really used it again if you want tho you can still send me an email to ayaadm730@gmail.com (very old but yuh idk lol)
~~i dont think someone will continue reading until here anyways so congrats if u are here you now know that i never thought someone would like to contact me for any reason or even read about me ?~~
